# Mixed Case

Oftentimes when you copy as news headline they come in ALL CAPS. I wasn't the biggest fan of having to retype all of them to reasonably use them, so I've created a simple command line utility (this was before learning of docopt) that handles this situation.
While I was add it, I made an option to format the string as; lower case, upper case, and a proper noun.

Usage:
main.py (lower|mixed|upper)
